Modern machine learning algorithms are designed to handle only numeric and boolean (True, False) data. So, as a preprocessing step, we will need to convert the categorical columns to numeric.

        "As you can see, working with machine learning involves working on a pipeline of various processes--we don't start with the machine learning algorithm. Before leaping into the ML algorithm, takes some time to explore the data, decide if it needs to be cleaned in any way, one-hot-encoded, if some features are not needed or if new ones need to be added.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we train a machine learning model (using `fit` in this case), the model learns a set of **parameters**. For example, in decision trees, one parameter is the depth of the tree. The depth isn't determined until the `fit` method finishes. The important point is that parameters are what the model learns on its own from analyzing the training dataset and not something we adjust.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast **hyperparameters** are things we determine and not determined by the algorithm. Hyperparameters are set before the model looks at the training data--in our case before `fit`.  For decision trees there are a number of these hyperparameters. We already saw two: `max_depth` controls the size of the tree and `criterion`. Adjusting one hyperparameter may improve the accuracy of your classifier or it may worsen it. \n",
        "\n",
        "We have already learned that we shouldn't test our model using the same data that we trained on. Why not? Because the model is already tuned to the specific instances in our training data. In a kNN classifier, it may memorize every instance in our training data--*Gabby Douglas who is 49 inches tall and weighs 90 pounds is a gymnast*.  If we test using that same data, the accuracy will tend to be higher than if we tested using data the classifier has never seen before. Again, if we told the algorithm someone who is 49 inches tall and 90 pounds is a gymnast, we shouldn't find it surprising that if we asked it what sport does someone play who is 49 inches and 90 pounds, and the algorithm predicts *gymnast*. We want to see if the algorithm learned or generalized something from processing the dataset. In some previous labs, we reserved 20% of the original data to test on and used 80% for training. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's imagine a process where we will adjust hyperparameters to improve the accuracy of our model. So we build a classifier with one setting of the hyperparameters and build another with a different setting for the hyperparameters and see which one is more accurate. One approach might be:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use 80% of the data to train on.\n",
        "2. Test the classifier using the 20% test set and get the accuracy.\n",
        "3. Adjust a hyperparameter and create a new classifier\n",
        "4. Use the same 80% of the data to train the new classifier\n",
        "5. Test the classifier using the 20% test set and get the accuracy.\n",
        "6. Keep repeating this to find the value of the hyperparameter that performs the best.\n",
        "7. The accuracy of your classifier will be the highest one obtained from evaluating the 20% test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with this approach is that since we are tuning the hyperparameters based on the accuracy on the test set, some of the information about the test set is leaking into our classifier. Let me explain about information leaking into the classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at our example of categorizing athletes into one of three categories: gymnast, basketball player, and marathoner. Leilani\n",
        "Mitchell is not in the training set but is in the test set. She is 5 foot 5 inches tall and weighs 138. Initially, she was among the instances in the test set that were misclassified. We kept adjusting the hyperparameters until we improved accuracy and now she is correctly classified as a basketball player. So we tuned our classifier to work well with her and others in the test set. That is what we mean by information from the test set leaking into the classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "So again, we may get an arbitrary higher accuracy that is not reflective of the algorithm's performance on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**So what can we do?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution is to divide the original dataset into three:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. the training set which we use to train our model.\n",
        "2. the validation set which we use to test our model so we can adjust the hyperparameters\n",
        "3. the test set which we use to perform an evaluation of the final model fit on the training set. We make our final adjustment of the hyperparameters **before** we evaluate the model using the test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many ways to divide up the original data into these three sets. For example, maybe 20% is reserved for the test set, 20% for validation and 60% for training.  However, there is a slightly better way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cross Validation\n",
        "For cross validation we are going to divide the dataset (typically just the training dataset) into roughly equal sized buckets. Typically we would divide the data into 10 parts and this is called 10-fold cross validation. To reiterate, with this method we have one data set which we divide randomly into 10 parts. We use 9 of\n",
        "those parts for training and reserve one tenth for validation. We repeat this procedure 10 times\n",
        "each time reserving a different tenth for validation.\n",

        "about 500 basketball players and 500 non-basketball players. \n",

        "We put 50 basketball players and 50 non-players in each bucket so each bucket contains information on 100 individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2. We iterate through the following steps 10 times\n",
        "\n",
        "1. During each iteration hold back one of the buckets. For iteration 1, we will hold back bucket 1, iteration 2, bucket 2, and so on.\n",
        "2. We will train the classifier with data from the other buckets. (during the first iteration we will train with the data in buckets 2 through 10)\n",
        "3. We will validate the classifier we just built using data from the bucket we held back and save the results. In our case these results might be: 35 of the basketball players were classified correctly and  29 of the non basketball players were classified correctly. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 3. we sum up the results.\n",
        "Once we finish the ten iterations we sum the results. Perhaps we find that 937 of the 1,000 individuals were categorized correctly. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summary\n",
        "Using cross-validation, every instance in our data is used in training and, in a different iteration, in validation. This results in a less biased model. By **bias** we mean that the algorithm is less accurate due to it not taking into account all relevant information in the data. With cross-validation we typically train on a larger percentage of the data than we would if we set aside a fixed validation set. One small disadvantage is that it now take 10 times as long to run.\n",

        "In the machine learning literature, n-fold cross validation (where n is the number of samples\n",

        "random element, it is likely that Emily and Li did not divide the data into buckets in exactly\n",
        "the same way. In fact, it is highly unlikely that they did. So when they train the classifier, they\n",
        "are not using exactly the same data and when they test this classifier they are using different\n",
        "test sets. So it is quite logical that they would get different results. This result has nothing to\n",
        "do with the fact that two different people were performing the evaluation. If Lucy herself ran\n",
        "10-fold cross validation twice, she too would get slightly different results. The reason we get\n",
        "different results is that there is a random component to placing the data into buckets. So 10-\n",
        "fold cross validation is called non-deterministic because when we run the test again we are\n",

        "Every time we use leave-one-out on the same classifier and the same data we will get the\n",
        "same result. That is a good thing!\n",
